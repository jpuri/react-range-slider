A collection of elegant slider components for React.
[Demo Page](http://jpuri.github.io/react-range-slider/).

## Installing

The library is available as npm package.

## Using the component
The component is easy to use. Import the library and add the component to your JSX:

import {Slider} from 'range-sliders';

const MyPage = () =>
  <div>
    <Slider />
  </div>;

An example of uncontrolled slider with single handle, `defaultValue` and `step` passed in props:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {RangeSlider} from 'reactrangeslider';

const MyPage = () =>
  <div>
    <Slider defaultValue={20} step={ 5 } />
  </div>;
```

An example of controlled range slider with two handles, `value` and `step` passed in props:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {RangeSlider} from 'reactrangeslider';

// value={ start: 20, end: 80 }
const MyPage = (value, onChange) =>
  <div>
    <RangeSlider
      value={ value }
      onChange={ onChange }
      min={ 20 }
      max={ 100 }
      step={ 5 }
    />
  </div>;
```

## Custom styling
Styling of Range Slider is highly customizable. It supports styling using both inline styles and classes. Internally the libary used inline styles, I have preferred that for ease of installation for users.

If inline styles are used for styling, the inline styles passed to it will override the defaults. If classes are used for styling, you will be required to use `!important` to override corresponding default inline style.

| Style Property | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `wrapperStyle`    | style applied to wrapper div element |
| `trackStyle`    | style applied to track |
| `disabledTrackStyle`    | style applied to track of disabled component |
| `highlightedTrackStyle`    | style applied to highlighted track |
| `disabledHighlightedTrackStyle`    | style applied to highlighted track of disabled component |
| `handleStyle`    | style applied to handle |
| `focusedHandleStyle`    | style applied to focused handle |
| `hoveredHandleStyle`    | style applied to hovered handle |

| `disabledHandleStyle`    | style applied to disabled handle |

| Class Name | Description |

| `wrapperClassName`    | class applied to wrapper div element |
| `handleClassName` / `disabledHandleClassName`   | either of these classes is applied to the handle depending on whether its enabled or disabled |

Styles applied to highlighted track are applicable only to Range Slider with two handles and highlighted area between them.
